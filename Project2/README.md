# Iphone Calculator APP

Description of the project:
The app that was developed functions almost identical to that of the generic Apple OS calculator. I made the colors match that of the dark theme colors, since those are the ones I have on my phone and I used it as a reference. 

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees buttons with numbers and operators, and a display with there most recent number clicked. 
* [ ] User can select any number they want 
* [ ] User can click on any operator and execute the operation between multiple numbers
* [ ] User can execute multiple operations consecutivley as long as a number is clicked in between operations. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* none we're used

## Notes
I would have liked to implement a function or try and catch so that if the user enters to operators consecutevly it doesnt crash the app. and just ignores the users request. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the challenges was the issue described in notes. 
Another was creating the gif.
the one that took me the most time to solve was how to add fuctionality to the buttons and how to find a efficient way to do so, I tried making a styles sheet at first then setting an id or click to all of them but found that complicated. I didn't want to do indivudal click listenrs so I eneded up using an array of id's. Would like to know if there is a way to implement the style sheet or a better way.
